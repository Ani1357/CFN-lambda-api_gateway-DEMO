# Serverless App (CFN+Lambda+API+CF+website)
A simple, yet not a "Hello World" webapp built when studying for AWS DVA exam. 

The focus of this project is to setup a CI/CD envoirment for delivering a serverless webapp hosted in S3 which uses an API Enpoint to retrive the data returned by our Lambda Function. The website will be hosted in S3 as a static file and reached through a CloudFront Distribution.
